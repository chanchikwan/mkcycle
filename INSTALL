Installation/usage
==================

1. To obtain a copy of mkcycle on your machine, you can simply use the
   standard git clone method:

      git clone git://nas-fermi.albanova.se/mkcycle

   Alternatively, you can also download a gzipped tar-ball from
   <http://nas-fermi.albanova.se/cgit.cgi/mkcycle.git> or
   <http://nas-fermi.albanova.se/gitweb.cgi/mkcycle.git>.

2. To build mkcycle, you need to have autoconf installed.  Simply cd
   into the mkcycle directory and run:
   
      ./mk
      ./mk clean
   
   A new executable "mkcycle" is generated.  `./mk clean` is not
   necessary but it erases useless files.

3. To use the cycle counter, copy the generated "mkcycle" executable
   to your source code directory and run

      ./mkcycle

   "mkcycle" is just like the standard "configure" script.  It check
   your system and generate the file "cycle.h", which is the fftw3
   cycle counter prefixed by the configure macro definitions.

   You can of course run `./mkcycle` within the mkcycle directory.  In
   that case, you can also compile "test.c" by

      gcc test.c -o test -O3 -Wall

   It is just an example showing you how to use the counter.
