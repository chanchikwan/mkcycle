Installation/usage
==================

1. The latest version of mkcycle is available on GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/chanchikwan/mkcycle.git

2. To build mkcycle, you need to have autoconf installed.  Simply `cd`
   into the mkcycle directory and run:

    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./bootstrap clean

   A new executable "mkcycle" is generated.  The second command
   `./bootstrap clean` is not necessary but it erases useless files.

3. To use the cycle counter, copy the generated "mkcycle" executable
   to your source code directory and run

    $ ./mkcycle

   "mkcycle" is just like a standard "configure" script.  It check
   your system and generate "cycle.h", which is the fftw3 cycle
   counter prefixed by the configure macro definitions.

   You can of course run `./mkcycle` within the mkcycle directory.  In
   that case, you can also compile "test.c" by

    $ gcc test.c -o test -O3 -Wall

   which is just an example showing you how to use the counter.
