Hi guys,

In case you care about performance and want to time different part of
your code, fftw3 provides a wonderful, portable, high resolution cycle
counter.  If you are familiar with autoconf, it's fairly easy to
incorporate it in your code.  Take a look at the "Cycle Counters"
section in the fftw download page:

    http://www.fftw.org/download.html

or you can get it directly from here:

    http://www.fftw.org/cycle.h

If you don't use autoconf, I have copy and paste some scripts together
to make it easier to use.  Just copy the following (modified)
configure script:

    apollo:/home/pitp017/cycle/mkcycle

`./mkcycle` will check your system and produce the header file
"cycle.h".  Include it in your code and the cycle counter is ready.
Also, take a look at the very simple example

   apollo:/home/pitp017/cycle/test.c

which shows using a for-loop to copy array of double is usually faster
than using memcpy().
