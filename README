Easy to use portable high resolution cycle counter
==================================================

fftw3 provides a portable high resolution cycle counter.  It is
described in the "Cycle Counters" section on the fftw download page:

    http://www.fftw.org/download.html

It uses macros defined in the header file "config.h" to pick the best
counter for different machines.

Not everyone is familiary with autoconf; or sometimes it is overkill
to use autoconf for a small project.  Therefore, I copy-and-pasted
cycle.h into a configure.ac file.  I then wrote a simple script `mk`
that runs autoconf and sticks the `configure` script and `cycle.hin`
together.

The resulting `mkcycle` scrip will check the system and produce the
header file "cycle.h".  Include it in the source code and the cycle
counter is ready.  Also, take a look at the very simple example
"test.c" which shows using a for-loop to copy array of double is
usually faster than using memcpy().
